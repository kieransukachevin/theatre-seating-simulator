In the screenshot, multiple seats have been sold (in grey) with L8 being the last seat sold.

## Install PyQt5:
Create a virtual environment to hold libraries:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
This creates the venv/ folder. To activate the virtual environment on Windows, run:
```bash
call venv/scripts/activate.bat
```
On Mac and Linux, use:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now in the virtual environment, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyQt5.
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```
Visit [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) for more.
